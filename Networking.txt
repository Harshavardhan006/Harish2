Computer network is a set of nodes connected by communications links

Nodes-computer,printer (capable of send/receive data) devices that are connected to a network
communication links-wired(ethernet-switch/hub) or wireless links(wifi)

protocol:
set of rules to communicate(data transmitted over a network)

Topology:
Network topology refers to the physical and logical arrangement of nodes on a network. The common network topologies include bus, star, ring, mesh, and tree.

ipaddress:(logical address)
Every node in the computer network is identified with help of ip address.Routers need ip address to forward data

Mac address:(physical address)
Every node in the LAN is identified with help of mac address.switch need mac add to forward data
DNS-Domain name server is used to translate human readable domain name such as (www.google.com) into ip address that computer can understand.
Firewall-Firewall is a security device that is used to monitor and control the incoming and outgoing 
 network traffic.It is used to protect network from unauthorized access and other network threats

Port address:
Every process in a node is uniquely identified using port numbers.
In a node many processess will be running,data which are sent/received must reach right process

Switching:
It helps in deciding the best route for data transmission if there ia multiple paths in a larger network.One to one connection

Types of Computer Network architecture:
1.Cilent-Server Architecture:Nodes can be server or cilents.Server node can manage the cilent node behaviour.
2.Peer-to-Peer Architecture:Each devices is free for working as either cilent or server




Layering:
means decomposing the problem into more manageable components(layers)
layered architectures:
1.The OSI reference model
2.The TCP/IP Model

The OSI model:
Open System Interconnection
It is model for understanding and designing a network architecture that is flexible,robust
The pupose of osi model is to facilitate communication b/w diff systems without requiring changes to logic of hardware,software
It is a guidelines ,was never fully implemented

OSI Model layers:[refer javatpoint]
Application layer:
it enables the user to access the newtwork resources.(This layer provide services to the user)
services
File tansfer and access management,mail services,directory services

Presentation layer:
It is responsible for translation,encryption and compressions.

Session layer:
it establishes,maintains,and synchronizes the interaction among communication devices.
services
dialog control,synchronization

Transport layer:
It is responsible for process to process delivery of entire msg
services
port addressing,Sgementation and reassembly,connection control,end to end flow control,error control.

Network layer:
It is responsible for delivery of data from original source to destination network.
services
logical addressing(ip address),routing

data link layer:
It is responsible for moving data(framing) from one node to another node
services
framing,physical addressing(mac address),flow control,error control,access control

Physical layer:
It is responsible for transmitting bits over a medium (wired or wireless medium)
Services
Representation of bits,Physical characteristics of media,data rate

TCP/IP:
Developed prior of osi model,it is implemented model
Application,transport,internet,network access

HUB:
used to set up LAN,layer 1
Has multiple ports,star topology,has no memory
When packet arrives at one port ,it is copied to the other ports so that all segments of LAN can see all packets-disadvantages

Switch:
It is a networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network to establish a LAN
It has memory,stores MAC address in table,layer 2 device for setting up LAN

Router:
It is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.
It is connected to at least two networks,commonly two LANs or WANs or a LANand its ISP's networks.
It is a layer 3(network layer) device,stores routing table



cmd:
1.ipconfig --ipaddress
2.ipconfig/all --macaddress
3.netstat -a --port address (or) resmon {It is an app it is not a command}
4.nslookup www.google.com --DNS Server: DNS stands for Domain Name System. DNS is basically a server that translates web addresses or URLs (ex: www.google.com) into their corresponding IP addresses. 
  We don’t have to remember all the IP addresses of each and every website. The command ‘nslookup’ gives you the IP address of the domain you are looking for. This also provides information on our DNS Server.
5.ping 142.250.195.164 -- 142 ...is a ipaddress of google.com or we can give (ping www.google.com).
  It checks whether google.com is reachable from my computer.And sends 4 packets and receives 4 packets means it is existing
6.tracert www.google.com --it will trace the route how it will reach the google.com like first will reach the default gateway that we see in ipconfig.
  This will show some details like timings, ipaddress from start to end ,end will ip address of google.com 
Port number for those protocals:
1.Https-Hypertext Transfer Protocal Secure.port 443
2.Http- " " " " port 80
3.SSH -Secure shell port 22 
4.FTP- File Transfer Protocal port 21 
5.SMTP-Simple mail transfer Protocal port 25 
6.SNMP-Simple network management Protocal port 161
7.DNS-Domain name System  port 53
8.DHCP-Dynamic host Configuration Protocal port 67 
9.Telnet-port 23 
10.RDP-Remote Desktop Protocal-3389
11.Stp-Spanning Tree Protocal-388


Networking Devices:
Repeater,Hub,Switch,Bridge,Router,gateway

1.Repeater:It is a physical Layer device and it regenrates and retransmits the incoming weak signal /data in a single LAN.2port device .It does not amplify signal or increase the signal strength.
2.Hub:It is a physical Layer device and it is used to connect multiple devices in a single LAN.It broadcasts the received single/data to all ports of the hub
Two Tyes:Passive hub,Active hub
3.Switch:It is a data link Layer device and it is used to connect multiple devices in  a single LAN.It examines the destination Mac add to the corresponding device.
4.Bridge:It is a data link layer and it is used to connect 2 LAN working on a same protocal.It is used to divide large network into smaller segments.It also has Mac add reading capability and also regenrates the weak signal.
5.Router:It is network layer device and it is used to connect multiple LAN and WAN together working on  same protocal.It needs ip address to forward the data.
6.Gateway(protocal Convertor):It is used to connect dissimilar networks together working on different set of protocols.Depending on the functionality a gateway can operate at any of the 7 layer of OSI model.




Internet Protocal Address:
*It is  a unique address used to identify a device in the Ip Network.
*2 Version of IP address:IPV4,IPV6
  IPV4-32 bit address
  IPV6-128 bit address 
*2 Types of IP address:
  Public IP
  Private Ip
*Ip address can be divided in to two positions. 
  Network Porition - It shows the Ip address of which network Porition
  Host Porition  - from the network it has the multiple host and from that it shows the specific host of Ip address 

IPV4 Address:It is made up of 32 binary bits.
             32 binary bits are broken in to 4 octets(1 octet =8 bits) and converted into decimals.
             The value of each octet ranges from 0 to 255 in decimal or binary.
             Decimal format of IPv4 is 192.68.10.11


Subnet-logical subdivision of an IP network or dividing ip network.Advantage of subnetting are  minimizes Broadcasting,Maximizes a Network Performance,secured.

Subnet Mask is a 32 bit number that is used to identify the network Portion and Host Portion in Ip address.
   1.Network bits as "1"
   2.Host bits as "0" 
Last octet  is reserved for specific function "0" indicates as a network address and "255" used to broadcasts.  

Types of Classes:Class A,Class B,Class C,Class D,Class Every
Class A -Ip ranges from 1.0.0.1 to 126.255.255.255, it supports 16,777,214 hosts on each 126 networks 
Subnet Mask-255.0.0.0
Network.Host.Host.Host<100.52.35.12>

Class B-Ip range from 128.0.0.1 to 191.255.255.255 ,it supports 65534 on each 16,382 networks
Subnet Mask-255.255.0.0 
Network.Network.Host.Host

Class C-Ip ranges from 192.0.0.1 to 223.255.255.255
Subnet mask-255.255.255.0
Network.Network.Network.Host 

Class D-Ip ranges from 224.0.0.1 to 239.255.255.255 
Reserved for Multicasting 

Class E-Ip ranges from 240.0.0.1 t0 254.255.255.255 
Reserved for Research and Development purpose 




Subnet-Division of Large IP Network into multiple small logical networks 
Two types of subnetting:1.Flsm=Fixed length subnet mask 
                        2.Vlsm=variable length subnet mask 

FLSM-Fixed Length Subnet mask 
      The main purpose is dividing the ip address with a same or equal size.
      Formula 2^n>=N      


VLAN-Virtual Local Area Network    
      Logical Group of devices that having same requirements are put in a single broadcast domain,that appreas working on a same LAN.Even they are in a different geographical locations   
      It is not restricted to a physical boundaries in a switched network.
      It can be spread across multiple switches in a Network or even mangaed in a single switch.
      Vlan ranges from 0 to 4095

      2 types of Ranges-Normal Range Vlan(1 to 1005)
                        Extended Range Vlan(1006 to 4095)
      Vlan 1 is known a native or default vlan    

Advantages:Network Broadcast message are minimized and hence network performace  be better.
           Easy Administration ,Flexible and easy to manage
           Reduced cost and securied.

Linux is a Operating System such as like windows,mac.

Unix-1970 (Bell Labs) mainly it is developed for multi user purpose and multi tasking. Unix was developed by Sun Microsystem.Unix supports only fewer file system.
Linux-1991 was found by Linus Torvalds.Linux is almost free because it is an open source software.Linux used by Developer community,Companies(Redhat,debian,CentOs)
Linux used by ATM machine,Smart Application,Home Application.

Uses of Virtual Box:It runs multiple Operating System in one Hardware.

Virtual Machine-Imaginary Computer

basic linux commands:
cal 
whoami
who 
halt 
shutdown 
reboot 

Linux file Management commands:
Types:
Normal files
directories 
Special files 

pwd-location 
ls-list of files and folders 
ls -l detailly shows files and folders 
ls -a hidden files  

vi - In vi we have two mode 
1.edit mode 
2.escape mode  
        





























































Cloud computing:

AWS-200 Fully featured services 

Infrastructure:
Server,storage,security,Database,network and application-6 Engineering those expert in all 6 engs they were called as solution architecture

Storage Engineering(Ec2):

ON-PREMISES =Buying/Depolying and Managing -Always manual and need more man-effort
             Chances of human error is high 
             to overcome this Ec2 was given by AWS Ec2-creating one computer over the internet in specific region

CLOUD PREMISES:
Regions:23 Active + 4 on progress Regions
Availabity Zones :77Az's 

EC2:Resizable Elastic cloud Computing(Elastic cloud computing)
END Goal:  Makes Developer job Easy...Avoids unneccesary wastage of Time in set up
Benefits:Cost Effective ,High Availabity,Easier&Faster,Resizable&Elastic

AWS MANAGEMENT CONSOLE CREATION:
Pricing -Free-tier Eligible


EC2 CREATION:
1.o/s(AMI-Amazon Machine Image) - windows,amazon,linux,ubuntu,suse,Redhat
2.H/W's(Instance type)-VCPU & Memory -t2.micro it has virtual cpu and ram =1 gb
  family -general purpose,memory optimization ,storage optimized,compute optimized
3.configuration:n/w,subnet,ip,bootstrap 
4.storage-ebs(elastic block store)upto 100 ebs can have ,1 ebs max capacity-16tb;via supports
5.tags-name the server
6.security group-(0-65535) source:0.0.0.0/0(public)
7.key pair generation -pem(privacy enhanced mail)Encrypted, private key
                       ppk(putty private key file)-decrypted ,public key
8.launch instances       

PRE-REQUISITES:
PUTTY-Login into linux
PUTTYGEN-IT converts PEM to ppk

Experiment1:Create Window machine login using(user name and pwd)
RDP-Remote Desktop protocal- Default Protocal of Window 3389(port number)
INITALIZING=1/2 INSTALLAtion +1/2 Configuration=2/2 checks passed
public ip of window machine
user name:To login first you should choose the machine after that click that connect  from that we can see RDP client we can the see user name
password:get password
Experiment 2:Create  Amazon Linux machine login using (user name and pwd(ppk))
SSH-secure shell -Default protocal of Linux 22(port number)
public ip address of linux
user name:To login first you should choose the machine after that click that connect  from that we can see SSH client we can the see user name
password:puttygen it is used to convert pem to ppk        


EC2 advance:
Ip address is static or Dynamic:Dynamic  Because everytime while restart your computer the ip address will be change.

Elastic IP Address:
Add Drive
Modify Drive
Snapshot
Linux commands --->add/Modify
Volume types


Elastic IP address and add drive:

In network and security we can see Elastic Ip from that you  can click allocate Elastic Ip address .Aws will be allocate an unique IP address 

In Elastic IP address click Action we can see Associate Elastic IP Address after that we should associate for those machine.

per account per region only 5 Ip's
Modify Drive:(min 1gb to max 16384gb)

In Elastic block store,click Volume we can see all the machine drive from that choose which drive to modify .click on action button from that we can the modify volume.after that it will be changed.here it will be changed but in remote it does not change how can we access.


Snapshot:
It is nothing but backup of  your harddisk. how to back up simply go to the volume click action from that Create Snapshot(Meaning:I had back up this harddisk) and give the name for those creation 
In snapshots we can see what we have back up.
Storage will be 30 gb 



Created the instances(windows) with two harddisk. one had disk as os and another one is 5gb.
5 gb harddisk were back up.It is not attached with any machine.





Linux in aws:
Commands:
df -h:use to view the file system 
lsblk:view the attached drives  
sudo mkfs -t ext4 
mkdir
mount
resize2fs   



EC2 Web Hosting:

1.AMI
2.RAM,CPU,NETWORK SPEED
3.NETWORK Configuration
4.STORAGE 30GB-EBS(elastic block store)
5.add tag 



Middleware-web server ,app server 

Webserver: Static application hosting 
apache-Linux
ITS-Internet Information Service (Microsoft Product) so window  

APP Server :Dynamic Application hosting  compulsory should have database storage 

 
 Application Engg-Depoly
 Deploy -installation,enhancement,update
 v1
 v1.1
 v1.2
 v2

know we going to install web server 
In Windows ,we should click sever manager
Add roles and features
we should go to server roles after that click web sever (IAS) then install 

In Linux we going to install web server:
